# web-dev-playground
My playground for code while attending [The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/share/100HQLA0QTeF5RRHQ=/)


[Lesson 65 - Startup Landing Page CSS Challenge](https://abirrazzak.github.io/web-dev-playground/65-startup-landing-page/ "Lesson 65")
Create a landing page for a start-up using CSS. Must include a background picture, some text, and a button that directs the user to a website. In this case, I made a landing page promoting Spotify Premium's feature to download playlists offline.
